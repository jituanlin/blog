## About this blog
This blog will contain some thoughts about my work and study. 
We will not talk about some tutorial or introduction, but further, touch some inspire. 
Programming is thinking. 
Unfortunately, I have see too much programmer coding for livelihood, they think that thinking is a burden that prevents them from completing their work. 
So we have seen so many terrible code, even if there is a better way to achieve it.
Maybe I never become a best programmer, but I want to keep my thoughts while programming, 
even as a Chinese programmer(You may not understand the hardships of Chinese programmers).

So I created this blog for recording my thinking of coding.
Maybe some understanding is naive and wrong, but it is also the growth process of a programmer.
If you find it is ridiculous, you may wish to communicate with me via [email](mailto:jituanlin@gmail.com).
